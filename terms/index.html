Your Agreement with Skygear</h5> <p>1.1 Your use of the Skygear service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “Skygear” means Oursky Limited, located at 10B, Great Wall Industry Building, Cheung Shun St, Cheung Sha Wan, Hong Kong, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Skygear Service. The “Skygear Services” means the services Skygear makes available through this website, including this website, the Skygear Developer Portal, the Skygear API, the Skygear Plugins, and any other software or services offered by Skygear in connection to any of those.</p> <p>1.2 In order to use the Skygear Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Skygear Services. You understand and agree that Skygear will treat your use of the Skygear Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p> <p>1.3 You may not use the Skygear Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Skygear Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Skygear Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Skygear Services are not intended for children under 13.</p> <p>1.4 You agree your purchases of Skygear Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Skygear or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p> <h5>2. Your Account and Use of the Skygear Services</h5> <p>2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Skygear Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Skygear immediately.</p> <p>2.2 Your use of the Skygear Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p> <p>2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Skygear Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Skygear in connection with the Skygear Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Skygear, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Skygear Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p> <p>2.4 Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained here (or such URL as Skygear may provide). The Skygear Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Skygear reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Skygear serving a “quota exceeded” page or “services temporarily not available” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Skygear Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.</p> <p>2.5 You may use the Skygear Services only to develop and run applications on the Skygear infrastructure. You may not access the Skygear Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Skygear or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Skygear Services.</p> <h5>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h5> <p>3.1 You agree to comply with the Skygear Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.</p> <p>3.2 The Skygear Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Skygear Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Skygear’s privacy policies.</p> <p>3.3 You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Skygear.</p> <h5>4. Fees for Use of the Skygear Services</h5> <p>4.1 Subject to the Terms, the Skygear Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at <a href=http://skygear.io/pricing rel=nofollow>http://skygear.io/pricing</a> (or such URL as Skygear may provide).</p> <p>4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Skygear fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Skygear incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Skygear’s measurements of your use of the Skygear Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Skygear and only in the form of credit for the Skygear Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Skygear to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Skygear may be shared by Skygear with companies who work on Skygear’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Skygear and servicing your account. Skygear may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Skygear shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Skygear reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Skygear Services to you for any late payments.</p> <p>4.3 Skygear may change its fees and payment policies for the Skygear Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Skygear may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p> <p>4.4 You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Skygear Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p> <h5>5. Content on the Skygear Services and Take Down Obligations</h5> <p>5.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Skygear Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content.” The term Content shall specifically exclude the web application that you create using the Skygear Services and any source code written by you to be used with the Skygear Services (collectively, “Applications”).</p> <p>5.2 Skygear reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from the Skygear Services. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable Use Policy, including pursuant to a take down request from Skygear. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Skygear to take down certain Content, Skygear reserves the right to directly take down such Content or to disable Applications.</p> <p>5.3 In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy by an End User of Applications, you shall immediately terminate such end user’s account on your Application. Skygear reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.</p> <p>5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Skygear has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Skygear Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Skygear may suffer) by doing so.</p> <p>5.5 You agree that Skygear has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.</p> <h5>6. Proprietary Rights</h5> <p>6.1 You acknowledge and agree that Skygear (or Skygear’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Skygear Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Skygear Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p> <p>6.2 Except as provided in Section 8, Skygear acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Skygear Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Skygear, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Skygear has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p> <h5>7. License from Skygear and Restrictions</h5> <p>7.1 Skygear gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Skygear as part of the Skygear Services as provided to you by Skygear.

To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Skygear for the use of the components of the Skygear Services released under an open source license.</p> <p>7.4 Skygear hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to display the Skygear trademarks and/or logos as provided here (“Marks”) for the sole purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the Skygear Services. You agree that all goodwill generated through your use of the Skygear Marks shall inure to the benefit of Skygear.</p> <h5>8. License from You</h5> <p>8.1 Skygear claims no ownership or control over any Content or Application. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in the Content and/or Application, and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying the Content on or through the Skygear Services you give Skygear a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling Skygear to provide you with the Skygear Services. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of the Skygear Services, you give Skygear a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Application for the sole purpose of enabling Skygear to provide you with the Skygear Services.</p> <p>8.2 By adding a collaborator to your Application, you hereby grant to that user a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to use, display, perform, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate and analyze such Application(s) and Content as permitted by the relevant Skygear Services functionality or features for the sole purpose of collaborating on development of the Application(s).</p> <p>8.3 You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Skygear Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Skygear Services or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Skygear under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.</p> <p>8.4 You agree that Skygear, in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the Skygear Services.</p> <h5>9. Recommendations</h5> <p>9.1 Skygear may, and you grant us permission to, make recommendations via the Skygear Services for products or services we think may be of interest to you based on your Application(s), Content, and/or use of the Skygear Services. We will never make recommendations directly to your End Users.</p> <h5>10. Modification and Termination of the Skygear Services</h5> <p>10.1 Skygear is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Skygear Services which Skygear provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Section 4.3. Changes to the form and nature of the Skygear Services will be effective with respect to all versions of the Skygear Services; examples of changes to the form and nature of the Skygear Services include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.</p> <p>10.2 You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the Skygear Services.

Skygear may have no control over any web sites or resources which are provided by companies or persons other than Skygear.</p> <p>15.2 You acknowledge and agree that Skygear is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such web sites or resources.</p> <p>15.3 You acknowledge and agree that Skygear is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you or your End Users as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.</p> <h5>16. Changes to the Terms</h5> <p>16.1 Skygear may make changes to the Terms from time to time.
